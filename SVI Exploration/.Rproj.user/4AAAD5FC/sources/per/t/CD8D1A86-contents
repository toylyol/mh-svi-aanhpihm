The latest [USAFacts.org coronavirus data](https://usafacts.org/issues/coronavirus) that is available for download is dated April 17, 2023. Both COVID case and death data are available. See the [methodology](https://usafacts.org/articles/detailed-methodology-covid-19-data/) for details about how it was collected.

There are several interesting [related articles](https://usafacts.org/articles/category/coronavirus/), including an [article](https://usafacts.org/articles/who-has-long-covid-heres-the-data-by-gender/) written indicating that transgender people had the highest rates of Long COVID based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau's [Week 52 Household Pulse Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2023/demo/hhp/hhp52.html). There is an [article](https://usafacts.org/articles/these-races-are-the-most-likely-to-develop-long-covid/) examining prevalence and severity of Long COVID by race. Another [article](https://usafacts.org/articles/covid-19-death-data-shows-racial-disparities-during-the-pandemic/) uses [CDC data](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Distribution-of-COVID-19-Deaths-and-Populations-by/jwta-jxbg) to highlight disproportionate deaths among racial minorities.
