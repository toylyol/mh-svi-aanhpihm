- The provided AANHPI template colors are #192c64 and #2d4fb4. Since the colors are too similiar to create a gradient for a continuous choropleth map, a color palette generator tool for categorical data was used.


- One color palette option using both template colors as a starting point is ["#98bddd", "#2480a1", "#2f4fb4", "#1c2c64"]. See the following files:
-- overall_mh_svi_map_TemplateColors2.svg
-- high_sv_map_TemplateColors2.svg


- A second color palette option using only the darkest template color (#192c64) as a starting point is ["#46ebdc", "#6ec1f8", "#15729c", "#1c2c64"]. See the following files:
-- overall_mh_svi_map_TemplateColors3
-- high_sv_map_TemplateColors3


- The two single-variable maps use the two provided template colors.
-- "asian_map_TemplateColors.svg" uses the darker template color (#192c64).
-- "nhpi_map_TemplateColors.svg" uses the lighter template color (#2d4fb4).


- The actual Minority Health SVI dashboard uses a Blue-Purple color palette from ColorBrewer2. It is specifically designed for maps and is color-blindness friendly. 
-- See all of the files ending in "_BuPu.svg" to view the maps with that color palette.
